# NSCR
AUR package installer script

**Even though the script has something like "Security check", it doesn't give guarantees of you being 100% secure just by using it. Downloading packages from AUR, always was, and will always be AT YOUR OWN RISK**  

***Using***  
Open console in the directory you have the script, and put ``./nscr.sh`` inside  
For the first time, script will ask you for package name to install  
The rest of the time, there will be two options, either install a new script, or update those you already have. Select by putting 1 or 2 accordingly
